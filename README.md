# CS 255 Module Eight Journal

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was the client who was seeking a comprehensive driver-training platform to help students pass their DMV driving tests. They wanted a system that could provide online lessons and practice tests, allow scheduling of on-the-road training sessions, process payments for lesson packages, and integrate up-to-date information from the DMV. The goal was to make driver education more convenient and effective by offering both online and in-person training options.

## What did you do particularly well?
I clearly defined the core features and interactions, making sure the diagrams and documentation showed how users would sign in, purchase lessons, and schedule sessions. This clarity helped ensure that every aspect of the system—from the database to the payment gateway—was accounted for. It also provided a solid foundation for developers and stakeholders to understand exactly how DriverPass should function.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would focus on refining all of my UML diagrams for greater detail and consistency. For example, I’d add clearer labeling on decision branches in the activity diagrams, improve the sequence diagram by showing alternative scenarios more explicitly, and unify the naming conventions in the class diagram. These changes would make the diagrams easier to understand at a glance and reduce any ambiguity about how the system handles different use cases or error conditions.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I relied on the business requirements document to pinpoint what was most important to DriverPass: the need for secure login, simple lesson scheduling, robust practice materials, and seamless payment flows. Translating these needs into clear diagrams and technical details ensures that the final product matches both the client’s vision and the users’ expectations. Designing with the user’s needs in mind means the final system will be more intuitive, reduce confusion or frustration, and ultimately help more students pass their driving tests.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I prefer an iterative approach that starts with gathering requirements, creating initial diagrams, and then refining those diagrams based on feedback. Techniques like use case analysis and user stories help me capture real-world scenarios, while UML diagrams guide the technical structure. Going forward, I would continue to rely on these strategies—plus regular communication with stakeholders—to ensure that the design remains aligned with actual needs and can adapt to any changes or additional insights that come up during development.
